# Dataset Creation:

The dataset utilized in this research represents a meticulous and comprehensive compilation of agricultural data, specifically curated to model and predict crop water requirements in a greenhouse context. The process of dataset preparation involved the collaboration of interdisciplinary teams, including agricultural experts, data scientists, and domain specialists. To ensure the dataset's richness and relevance, information was gathered on a diverse array of crops, ranging from staple grains to fruits and cash crops. Each entry in the dataset is characterized by a set of features crucial for understanding the intricate relationships between crops and their environmental conditions. The features include the crop type, climate zone, soil type, ideal temperature, humidity preferences, water requirements measured in millimeters, and the typical lifespan or growth cycle duration of the crops. To enhance the dataset's accuracy, inputs were sourced through extensive surveys conducted among agriculture students, consultations with farmers, and the integration of existing agricultural knowledge. This collaborative and multidisciplinary approach ensured that the dataset encapsulates the nuanced requirements of various crops, laying the groundwork for the development of a robust decision tree regression model that accurately predicts water needs and facilitates the generation of tailored irrigation schedules for optimized greenhouse cultivation.

# Data Preprocessing:

In the preparatory phase of this project, meticulous data preprocessing played a pivotal role in refining the raw agricultural dataset, ensuring its suitability for training the decision tree regression model. The dataset underwent a thorough examination for missing values, with strategic imputation or removal of incomplete entries to preserve data integrity. Outlier detection and treatment strategies were implemented to address potential anomalies that could impact model training. Numerical features underwent standardization through scaling techniques, ensuring uniform influence during model training. Categorical variables were encoded into numerical representations, facilitating the model's interpretation of such data. The dataset was strategically split into training and validation sets, enabling robust model training and evaluation. Feature selection methods were employed to identify the most influential variables, streamlining the dataset for optimal model performance. Additionally, the target variable representing water requirements underwent normalization for consistency and improved model convergence during training. This comprehensive data preprocessing approach resulted in a refined and well-structured dataset, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent training and evaluation of the decision tree regression model. 

# Model Selection :

The comparative analysis conducted for model selection in this project involved evaluating various supervised learning models to determine the most effective approach for predicting optimal irrigation schedules. Commonly considered models in this comparative analysis might include Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree Regression. The evaluation criteria encompassed factors such as predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, interpretability, and the model's ability to handle the complex relationships inherent in predicting water requirements for diverse crops. Additionally, consideration was given to the specific characteristics of the dataset, including the number of features, the nature of the target variable, and the potential presence of non-linear relationships. Performance metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared, were employed to quantitatively assess the models' predictive capabilities. The interpretability of each model was qualitatively evaluated, recognizing the importance of transparent decision-making, particularly in agricultural applications. 
Ultimately, the Decision Tree Regression model was selected based on its favorable balance of predictive accuracy, interpretability, and suitability for handling the complex and non-linear relationships involved in predicting water requirements for crops in a greenhouse environment. This choice was made after a thorough examination of the strengths and weaknesses of each model through the lens of the specific requirements and characteristics of the irrigation scheduling prediction task.  

# Training and Validation:

In the training and validation phase of this project, the decision tree regression algorithm played a pivotal role in creating a model capable of predicting water requirements for various crops in a greenhouse setting. The dataset, comprising information on temperature, humidity, soil type, and other attributes relevant to crop growth, was divided into training and validation sets. The training set was employed to teach the model patterns within the data, enabling it to establish relationships between input features and the corresponding water requirements. The decision tree model was fine-tuned during training to enhance its predictive accuracy. 
To ensure the model's generalizability and prevent overfitting to the training data, a validation set was utilized. This set, distinct from the training data, enabled the assessment of the model's performance on unseen data. By iteratively adjusting model parameters and evaluating its performance on the validation set, we aimed to strike a balance between predictive power and avoiding overly complex models that might not generalize well. This iterative process of training, validation, and adjustment was crucial for refining the decision tree model, ensuring its robustness, and ultimately producing an accurate and practical tool for predicting crop water requirements and generating irrigation schedules in a greenhouse environment. 

# User Interaction :

In the user interaction phase of this project, a user-friendly interface was developed using a Flask-based graphical user interface (GUI) application. 

Input:
The user is prompted to input the name of the crop for which they seek irrigation recommendations. As shown in figure 2. Upon entering the crop name, the system fetches relevant data from the dataset, providing the user with optimal weather conditions for 
cultivating the selected crop.
